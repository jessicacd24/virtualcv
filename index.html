        <p  class="description"><img alt="Avatar" class="avatar" src="img/avatar.jpeg"/>I am an electrical engineer graduated from the Central University of Venezuela, with experience in project engineering.
            A few years ago I began to get involved in the world of programming by taking courses in Venezuela, then in 2019
            I came to Barcelona Spain to do a Master in High Performance Web Development and I did several online courses to
            complement my knowledge.
            I am currently doing a Master in Programming and I continue with my studies online on the different platforms.
